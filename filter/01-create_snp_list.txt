#Quick step to make list of snp positions from vcf file (keeping "CHROM" and "POS" info)
#This is for later creating lists of subsets to use in vcftools --exclude-positions

awk '{print $1, $2}' imputed.vcf > list_all

#then use nano to edit header so it only says "CHROM POS" on top- helps it read easier in R
